============

The book [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) uses a simple text based game as an example when teaching the reader the lisp programming language. 

As an experiment, I wanted to see how that code would look in other languages. 

This repository is an attempt at collecting versions of the game in different languages so that readers have a chance to compare the brevity, expressiveness, etc of the languages involved. 

Know of a language which doesn't have an implementation and have an hour to spare? Feel free to contribute!
