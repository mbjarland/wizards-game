============

The book [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) uses a simple text based wizard game as an example when teaching the reader the lisp programming language. 

I think the idea is perfect for demonstrating the expressiveness, brevity, and beauty of a language so I wanted to see how a solution to that problem would look in other languages.  

This repository is an attempt at collecting versions of the game in different languages so that readers have a chance to compare them and a chance to see how a solution in another language might look.

Know of a language which doesn't have an implementation and have an hour to spare? Feel free to contribute!
